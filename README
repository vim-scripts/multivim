Based on bcbuf.vim (vimscript #201), this script allows the user to open a new vim window from within vim, and manage the buffers in all open vim sessions (windows) in a centralized manner. One can:









0. Open a new vim window from within vim by the command ":nf"









1. Yank and Put across multiple sessions using the usual mappings.









2. Edit a file, first in one session, then in another, using :edit, :split, :vsplit, etc.









3. Look at all buffers in all sessions using :files, :buffers, etc.









4. Push a command from one session's history and pop it in another.









For more details look at the comments at the start of the script.
